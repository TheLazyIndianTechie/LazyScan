# LazyScan Testing Strategy and Coverage Roadmap

## Overview

This document defines the comprehensive testing strategy for LazyScan v1.0, establishing layered testing coverage with an 80%+ code coverage target to ensure safe deletion operations and data integrity.

## Testing Philosophy

LazyScan handles destructive operations that could result in data loss. Our testing strategy prioritizes safety through:

- **Zero Data Loss**: All deletion paths must be thoroughly tested
- **Safe Mocking**: Use pyfakefs for filesystem operations in tests
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: 80%+ code coverage with focus on critical safety paths
- **Multiple Test Layers**: Unit, integration, and end-to-end testing

## Testing Architecture

### Layer 1: Unit Tests (`tests/unit/`)
**Target Coverage**: 90%+ for critical modules

**Scope**:
- Individual scanner modules (Unity, Unreal, Chrome discovery)
- Deletion validators and safety checks
- Path handlers and normalization
- Configuration parsing and validation
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms

**Key Focus Areas**:
- Safe deletion validation logic
- Path exclusion rules
- Cross-platform path handling
- Cache size calculations
- Error message generation

**Tools**:
- pytest (latest 7.x) as testing framework
- pyfakefs (latest 4.x) for safe filesystem mocking
- pytest-mock for external dependency mocking
- parametrized tests for cross-platform scenarios

### Layer 2: Integration Tests (`tests/integration/`)
**Target Coverage**: 85%+ for inter-module workflows

**Scope**:
- Multi-application discovery workflows
- Cache calculation aggregation
- Configuration loading and merging
- Error propagation across modules
- Backup and recovery workflows
- CLI command integration

**Key Focus Areas**:
- Unity Hub project discovery → cache scanning
- Unreal project detection → cache aggregation
- Chrome profile scanning → safe deletion validation
- Configuration precedence (system → user → CLI)
- Audit logging across operations

**Tools**:
- pytest fixtures for complex test data
- Mock external APIs/services
- Representative dataset fixtures per application
- Temporary directory isolation

### Layer 3: End-to-End Tests (`tests/e2e/`)
**Target Coverage**: 95%+ for complete workflows

**Scope**:
- Complete CLI workflows from discovery to deletion
- Backup creation and recovery scenarios
- Audit logging throughout full operations
- Error recovery and rollback mechanisms
- Cross-platform behavior validation

**Key Focus Areas**:
- Full safe deletion lifecycle
- Backup integrity and recovery validation
- Configuration migration scenarios
- Performance benchmarks (< 30s for 100GB+ scans)
- CLI user experience flows

**Tools**:
- Real filesystem testing with isolated environments
- CLI subprocess testing
- Performance profiling integration
- Backup validation and recovery testing

## Critical Safety Paths

### Priority 1 (P0) - Must Have 100% Coverage
1. **Safe Deletion Validation**
   - Path existence verification
   - Permission checks
   - Exclusion list enforcement
   - System path protection

2. **Backup Creation**
   - Atomic backup operations
   - Integrity hash validation
   - Recovery metadata generation
   - Storage space verification

3. **Audit Logging**

   - Error state capture
   - Recovery information storage
   - Tamper resistance

4. **Recovery Mechanisms**
   - Backup restoration workflows
   - Rollback on failure scenarios
   - Data integrity verification
   - Recovery window enforcement

### Priority 2 (P1) - Target 95% Coverage
- Cache discovery algorithms
- Size calculation accuracy
- Configuration validation
- Cross-platform path handling
- Performance optimization paths

### Priority 3 (P2) - Target 80% Coverage
- UI rendering and animations
- Progress tracking
- Non-critical error handling
- Optional feature paths

## Test Data Management

### Mock Filesystem Structure
Using pyfakefs to create safe, reproducible test environments:

```
/mock-home/
├── .config/lazyscan/
│   └── config.toml
├── Library/
│   ├── Caches/Unity/
│   ├── Application Support/Unreal Engine/
│   └── Application Support/Google/Chrome/
└── test-projects/
    ├── unity-project-1/
    └── unreal-project-1/
```

### Test Datasets
- **Small Dataset**: 1GB simulated cache data
- **Medium Dataset**: 10GB simulated cache data
- **Large Dataset**: 100GB+ simulated cache data
- **Edge Cases**: Empty caches, permission denied, corrupted data

## Cross-Platform Testing Strategy

### Platform Matrix
- **macOS**: Primary development platform
- **Linux**: Ubuntu 20.04+ (CI/CD)
- **Windows**: Windows 10+ (CI/CD)

### Path Testing Scenarios
- macOS: `~/Library/Caches`, `~/Library/Application Support`
- Linux: `~/.cache`, `~/.config`, `~/.local/share`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%`, `%LOCALAPPDATA%`, `%TEMP%`

### Environment Variables
- Test expansion of `$HOME`, `%USERPROFILE%`, `$XDG_CACHE_HOME`
- Unicode and special character handling
- Long path support (Windows 260+ character limitation)

## Test Infrastructure

### Framework Configuration
```python
# pytest.ini
[tool:pytest]
testpaths = tests
python_files = test_*.py
python_classes = Test*
python_functions = test_*
addopts =
    --verbose
    --cov=lazyscan
    --cov-report=xml:reports/coverage.xml
    --cov-report=html:reports/coverage_html
    --cov-report=term-missing
    --cov-fail-under=80
markers =
    unit: Unit tests
    integration: Integration tests
    e2e: End-to-end tests
    slow: Slow-running tests
    safe: Tests that don't touch real filesystem
```

### Coverage Configuration
```ini
# .coveragerc
[run]
source = lazyscan

omit =
    tests/*
    setup.py
    lazyscan/__version__.py

[report]
precision = 2
show_missing = True
skip_covered = False

[html]
directory = reports/coverage_html
```

### Tox Configuration (Python 3.9-3.12)
```ini
# tox.ini
[tox]
envlist = py39, py310, py311, py312, lint, coverage

[testenv]
deps =
    pytest>=7.0
