# Research Session

## Initial Query

**Question:** dependency

**Response:**

## Overview of Dependency Management Considerations  
For the Lazyscan project, sound dependency management underpins both the emerging CI/CD pipeline (Task 30) and the feature work that depends on reliable third-party libraries (Tasks 26–29). Establishing clear policies ensures repeatable builds, predictable behavior across the multi-OS/Python matrix, and traceable updates when security patches arrive. Two guiding principles are recommended: maintain explicit version constraints for all production dependencies (via `pyproject.toml`/`requirements.lock` or similar) and automate verification of dependency integrity during continuous integration.

## Version Pinning & Resolution Strategy  
Given the need to support Python 3.8–3.12 across Linux, macOS, and Windows, adopt a resolver that can produce deterministic dependency sets. Using `uv` or `pip-tools` to generate a lock file per major Python version is a common approach, while Poetry also works if runtime scripts are compatible. For this codebase, storing a single `requirements.txt` generated from a `pyproject.toml` (PEP 621 metadata) offers compatibility with GitHub Actions’ caching. Ensure extras for tasks (e.g., `cryptography`, `pydantic`, `tomli-w`, `ruff`, `bandit`, `mypy`, `pytest-cov`) are carefully scoped so the minimal runtime install excludes optional tooling.

## Dependency Updates and Security Gates  
Task 30’s security gate should incorporate SCA (software composition analysis). Integrate tools like `pip-audit`, `safety`, or GitHub’s native Dependabot alerts alongside `bandit`. In practice, add an SCA stage in the CI workflow that runs `pip-audit --strict` against the resolved lock file, failing the build when CVEs exist without patches. Combine this with Dependabot PRs configured for weekly updates; the CI matrix will immediately smoke-test upgrades on all supported interpreters.

## Reproducibility for Local and CI Environments  
To avoid “works on my machine” scenarios, codify environment bootstrapping. Provide `make` or `just` targets (e.g., `make install`, `make lint`) that install dependencies using the lock file. Document the process in `CONTRIBUTING.md`, suggesting `uv sync` or `pip install -r requirements.txt` followed by `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`. In GitHub Actions, enable dependency caching (`actions/setup-python@v5` cache, or `uv`’s built-in) keyed by lock-file hash. This keeps CI fast while ensuring any dependency change invalidates caches.

## Specialized Dependencies for Upcoming Tasks  
- **Task 29 (TOML configuration):** Confirm Python ≥3.11 availability for `tomllib` while providing `tomli` backport for 3.8–3.10. Pin `pydantic>=2.5.3`, `platformdirs`, `tomli-w`.  
- **Task 28 (Encrypted audit logs):** Pin `cryptography>=41.0.7`, `keyring>=24.3.0`. On macOS runners, ensure the CI workflow sets `PYTHON_KEYRING_BACKEND=keyring.backends.null.Keyring` to prevent interactive prompts.  
- **Task 27 (System cleanup utilities):** Add optional dependencies like `psutil` or OS-specific helpers behind extras; mark them as optional to avoid bloating the base installation.  
- **Task 26 (Developer tool caches):** Utilize `pyfakefs` for tests (pin version compatible with Python 3.12) and consider optional JetBrains-specific libraries if needed.

## Supply Chain Hardening Practices  
Adopt hash-checking installs (e.g., `pip install --require-hashes` or `uv`’s locked hashes) for production-critical dependencies. Store lock files under version control so audits capture historical dependency states. For release builds, record SBOMs (Software Bill of Materials) using `pipdeptree --json-tree` or `syft` to track dependency lineage—valuable for compliance in Tasks 28 and 30.

## Actionable Next Steps  
1. Finalize `pyproject.toml` with explicit dependency groups (`[project.optional-dependencies] dev = [...]`).  
2. Generate language-version-aware lock files using `uv pip compile` or `pip-compile --resolver=backtracking --all-extras`.  
3. Update `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to install dependencies from lock files, run `pip-audit`, and cache based on lock hash.  
4. Document dependency workflows in CONTRIBUTING to keep local environment setup aligned with CI expectations.
