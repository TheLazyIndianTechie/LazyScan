			"expansionPrompt": "Propose ~11 subtasks to set up a robust testing stack: pytest/pytest-cov initialization and pytest.ini markers; tox (v4) envs for py39–py312; pre-commit hooks integrating tests and ruff/black; pyfakefs and pytest-mock fixtures; unit tests per module (scanner, validators, path handlers); integration tests for Unity/Unreal/Chrome discovery and cache calc; E2E workflows covering deletion, backups, audit, recovery; cross-platform parametrization (Windows/macOS/Linux) for path and permissions; coverage thresholds and XML (Cobertura) report generation; CI integration to run layers selectively; documentation on running/debugging tests and flake mitigation. For each subtask include goal, deliverables, and acceptance criteria.",
			"reasoning": "High effort due to multi-layer testing, cross-platform behaviors, filesystem mocking, and 80%+ coverage with critical safety paths. Requires tooling integration (tox, pre-commit, CI) and stable E2E flows."

			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,

Provide acceptance criteria per OS and app.",
			"reasoning": "Non-trivial cross-platform path logic, environment expansion, permissions, and caching with TTL; must be extensible and well-tested across OSes."

Include acceptance criteria for failure messages and rollback.",
			"reasoning": "Complex due to schema design, migration from legacy format, hot-reload, merging precedence, and cross-platform discovery locations. High testing burden and user-facing reliability requirements."

Include acceptance criteria for clarity and usefulness of guidance.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate-high complexity: unified error taxonomy, user guidance, structured logging, and retries across code paths; must balance UX with maintainability and privacy."

Include acceptance criteria for schema validation and CLI flags.",
			"reasoning": "Requires schema design, serialization across types, streaming for scale, and CLI integration; testing must validate schema conformance and performance."
