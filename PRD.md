## Document Information
- **Product Name:** LazyScan

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Product Overview
LazyScan is a cyberpunk-styled, cross-platform disk space analysis and cache management tool designed for developers who need to quickly identify and reclaim disk space consumed by development tools, browsers, and system caches. Built with a modular architecture, LazyScan combines powerful scanning capabilities with safe deletion mechanisms and comprehensive audit trails.

### 1.2 Problem Statement
Developers frequently face disk space issues due to accumulated caches from:
- Game engines (Unity, Unreal Engine) with multi-gigabyte cache directories
- Development tools (VS Code, Xcode) storing derived data
- Browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) accumulating cache over time
- System-level caches on macOS, Linux, and Windows
- Node.js projects with large node_modules directories

Current solutions are either:
- Too generic (no specific support for developer tools)
- Too dangerous (no safety mechanisms or audit trails)
- Too complex (requiring advanced technical knowledge)
- Platform-specific (lack cross-platform support)

### 1.3 Solution
LazyScan provides:
- **Targeted Discovery:** Intelligent detection of game engine projects, browser profiles, and system caches
- **Safe Operations:** Backup-first deletion, audit logging, and recovery mechanisms
- **Developer-Friendly UX:** Cyberpunk-styled terminal UI with progress animations and clear feedback
- **Cross-Platform Support:** Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows with platform-specific optimizations
- **Modular Architecture:** Plugin-based extensibility for adding new application integrations

### 1.4 Success Metrics
- **User Adoption:** 10,000+ monthly active users within 6 months
- **Disk Space Reclaimed:** Average of 5-10 GB per user per session
- **Safety:** Zero data loss incidents due to tool malfunction
- **Performance:** Scan completion in under 30 seconds for typical developer machines
- **User Satisfaction:** 4.5+ star rating on GitHub and package managers

## 2. Product Vision & Strategy

### 2.1 Vision Statement
"Become the go-to disk space management tool for developers worldwide, seamlessly integrating with their workflow while maintaining the highest standards of safety and user experience."

### 2.2 Target Audience

#### Primary Users
1. **Game Developers**
   - Unity and Unreal Engine developers
   - Need to manage large project caches (1-50 GB per project)
   - Work with multiple projects simultaneously
   - Require selective cache clearing without breaking builds

2. **Software Developers**
   - Full-stack, mobile, and desktop developers
   - Use VS Code, Xcode, Android Studio
   - Need to manage node_modules, build artifacts, derived data
   - Value automation and CLI tools

3. **System Administrators**
   - Manage developer workstations
   - Need automated cleanup scripts
   - Require audit trails for compliance
   - Value safety mechanisms

#### Secondary Users
1. **Power Users:** Tech-savvy individuals managing personal machines
2. **Students:** Computer science students learning development tools
3. **DevOps Engineers:** Managing CI/CD runners and build servers

### 2.3 Product Positioning
LazyScan positions itself as:
- More developer-focused than general disk cleaners (CCleaner, CleanMyMac)
- Safer than manual deletion or custom scripts
- More flexible than built-in OS tools (Storage Management)
- More accessible than low-level tools (du, ncdu)

### 2.4 Competitive Analysis
